         Founded in 1948 in Worthington, Ohio, The Ohio Railway Museum is one of the oldest and most pioneering railroad museums in the United States. 
         Our journey began with the acquisition of the Ohio Public Service Interurban Car #21, a treasured artifact proudly listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
         Our mission is to not only preserve the rich history of railroads but also to educate the public on their profound impact on the development of Ohio and the nation. 
         Through engaging displays, interactive demonstrations, and historical artifacts, we aim to bring the fascinating history of railroading to life. 
         The museum operates on the historic Columbus, Delaware, and Marion (CD&M) railbed, 
         a line established in 1901 to provide essential passenger and freight services across 60 miles, connecting Columbus, Worthington, Delaware, and Marion. 
         Though the CD&M ceased operations in 1933 after filing for bankruptcy, its legacy is preserved and celebrated at our museum. 
         Our collection boasts a range of historic pieces, including the last CD&M interurban parlor car #501, affectionately known as "The Red Bird."

         Visitors to the museum can delve into the evolution of rail travel through our comprehensive exhibits, 
         featuring both electric traction and steam equipment. We offer scenic rides on vintage streetcars and Pullman passenger cars, 
         providing a dynamic way to experience a bygone era of railroading. We invite visitors to join us on this historical journey, 
         exploring a century of transportation technology and innovation.
