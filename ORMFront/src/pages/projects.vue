         We are elated to share the remarkable success of Tommy Zielinskiâ€™s Eagle Scout Project from Troop 85 in Westerville. Tommy embraced the challenging task of restoring and repairing a dilapidated baggage cart, and his hard work has transformed it into a stunning exhibit for the museum. The dedication of Tommy, his troop, and his family culminated in the revival of this historical piece. Congratulations, Tommy, on completing this project! Your commitment to scouting is truly commendable, and we are very proud of your accomplishment.

         Bill has been hard at work, and we're thrilled to share that he has added the final touches to his project. The iconic red strip and numbering, along with the shield, have been meticulously applied, with minor touch-ups enhancing the overall appearance. While we have exciting future plans for the GE B23-7 cab, those will need to be set aside momentarily as we redirect our focus to the upcoming holiday events.
