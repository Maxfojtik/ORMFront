         It's one thing to talk about trains or to see them on television. It's something else to see them up close or to actually ride them. 
         At the Ohio Railway Museum we are very much focused on the experience. Come see trains in a whole new way and get a taste of what this
            country was like when rail travel was a part of everyday life. Our staff is eager to immerse you in the culture of railroading.
